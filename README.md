# Íùödepend

Mind that this Gem is very experimental, a work in progress

It generates a graph visualization of the dependencies in your codebase.

A lot of incoming links are good, as that means that a function/module is
re-used a lot.
A lot of outgoing links a bad, as that means that that part of the code has
a lot of dependencies.
